  If you’re over 45, you might have noticed some changes in how you feel as you
  age. For many men, the prostate naturally grows over time—starting about the
  size of a walnut in your 20s and potentially increasing as the years go by.


  This can sometimes lead to discomfort, like that frequent “need to go” feeling
  or occasional tiredness, which might affect your daily life.


  Here’s the good news! Experts have explored a simple, 21-second evening
  routine inspired by Japanese traditions that may help support prostate comfort
  and overall wellness.


  Even better? It’s something you can try at home using common, natural
  ingredients you might already have on hand.


  If you or someone you know is curious about gentle ways to care for prostate
  health, click below to watch a short, free video featuring Dr. Collins, who
  shares insights on this easy approach.
